# ackermmanFunction
In this Java project, I worked with recursive methodology to enable the computation of the Ackermman function. Recursion is commonly used in traversing of binary trees, sorting algorithms, and many naturally recursive problems like in computing Fibonacci sequences. Recursive principles are also commonly found in mathematics, such as in integration by parts or in recursive representations of series.
